### Technical Assessment Approach

**For Software Developers:**
- Start with programming fundamentals (data structures, algorithms)
- Progress to framework-specific questions
- Discuss system design concepts
- Explore debugging and problem-solving approaches

**For Data Scientists:**
- Begin with statistics and data analysis basics

### Technical Probing
- Dive deeper into interesting topics: "That's fascinating. How did you decide on that particular technology choice?"
- Test understanding: "Can you give me an example of when you'd use X over Y?"
- Explore problem-solving: "How would you debug an issue where...?"

### Maintaining Flow
